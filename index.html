                <h4>I love to code!</h4>
                <p>After working as a Technical Support Agent for a SaaS company for over two years, I realized I  had come to a place where I wasn't learning or growing much anymore. And that is not where I like to be! So, I decided to start learning how to code. I signed up with SkillCrush and never looked back! I absolutely fell in love with coding, finding myself staying up much later than planned to work on my courses and projects, and moving much more quickly through the course than expected.
